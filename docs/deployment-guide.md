# Deployment Guide

## Overview

This document provides a step-by-step guide to deploying the Nexuria architecture.

## Prerequisites

* **Infrastructure**: A cloud provider (e.g. AWS, GCP, Azure) or on-premises infrastructure
* **Docker**: Docker installed on the infrastructure
* **Kubernetes**: Kubernetes installed on the infrastructure

## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Create a Docker Image

* Create a Dockerfile for each microservice
* Build the Docker image for each microservice
* Push the Docker image to a container registry (e.g. Docker Hub)

### Step 2: Create a Kubernetes Cluster

* Create a Kubernetes cluster on the infrastructure
* Configure the Kubernetes cluster to use the container registry

### Step 3: Deploy the API Gateway

* Create a Kubernetes deployment for the API Gateway
* Configure the API Gateway to route requests to the microservices

### Step 4: Deploy the Microservices

* Create a Kubernetes deployment for each microservice
* Configure each microservice to communicate with the API Gateway and Data Storage

### Step 5: Deploy the Data Storage

* Create a Kubernetes deployment for the Data Storage
* Configure the Data Storage to store and retrieve data for the microservices

### Step 6: Deploy the Security Components

* Create a Kubernetes deployment for the Security components
* Configure the Security components to authenticate and authorize requests

### Step 7: Configure Monitoring and Logging

* Configure monitoring and logging for the entire architecture

### Step 8: Test and Validate

* Test and validate the entire architecture to ensure it is working as expected
