# Nexuria Architecture

## Overview

Nexuria is a highly scalable and modular architecture designed to support a wide range of applications and services. The architecture is built around a microservices-based approach, with each component designed to be highly available, fault-tolerant, and easily maintainable.

## Components

### API Gateway

* Handles incoming requests from clients
* Routes requests to appropriate microservices
* Provides authentication and authorization
* Supports load balancing and caching

### Microservices

* **QRBC (Quantum-Resistant Blockchain)**: Provides a secure and decentralized ledger for storing and managing data
* **NeuroNetwork**: Provides real-time optimization of the Pi Network
* **GAP (Global Adoption Platform)**: Provides a seamless onboarding experience for users, businesses, and governments

### Data Storage

* **Database**: Stores and manages data for the application
* **Cache**: Provides fast and efficient data retrieval

### Security

* **Authentication**: Handles user authentication and authorization
* **Encryption**: Encrypts data in transit and at rest

## Interactions

* **API Gateway** -> **Microservices**: Routes requests to appropriate microservices
* **Microservices** -> **Data Storage**: Stores and retrieves data
* **Microservices** -> **Security**: Authenticates and authorizes requests

## Benefits

* Highly scalable and modular architecture
* Highly available and fault-tolerant components
* Easy maintenance and updates
* Secure and decentralized data storage
* Real-time optimization of the Pi Network
* Seamless onboarding experience for users, businesses, and governments
